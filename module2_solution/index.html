                <h2>Maharana Pratap</h2>
                <p>
                    Maharana PratapMaharana Pratap (or Rana Pratap Singh) was one of the bravest Kings of Mewar. He is famous in Indian history for successfully fighting against the army of the Great Mughal Emperor Akbar.Maharana Pratap was a Rajput. He was the son of the great Maharana Udai Singh, who was the founder of the city of Udaipur. He was born on 9th May, 1540.There were many warrior Kings in the history of India, who in respect of personal valor, capacity for government, diplomatic acumen and qualities of generalship were equal to or in some respects even superior to Maharana Pratap, but the subsequent generations have accorded special honor to Maharana Pratap.The sole reason of this was his refusal to submit to Akbar on the ground that bartering away one’s liberty to secure any honor is unworthy of a self-respecting person.
